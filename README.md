<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

## Development

1. Clone the repo:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mets-programme/esm-ugandaemr-bed-management-app.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies by running `yarn`:
  
    ```sh
    yarn
    ```

3. Run a dev server:

    ```sh
    yarn start
    ```
    > To develop features and fixes for UgandaEMR+, you'll need to proxy to a UgandaEMR+ backend by passing a backend server URL as the argument of the `--backend` flag e.g. `yarn start --backend https://ugandaemr-backend.mets.or.ug`
